# easyAI
User-friendly YOLO application

Python 3.13.2

## What is YOLO and What makes easyAI, easy ?
This is a desktop application that allows users to run YOLO object detection on videos easily.

The application lets you select any YOLO model and any video file from your computer.

The next versions of tthis application will include annotation tools, YOLO model

training, and real-time object detection from various sources (camera, images, etc.)



YOLO (You Look Only Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm that quickly identifies

and classifies multiple objects in images or videos in a single pass.
